## Before opening a pull request

1. Make sure all unit tests are passing.
```bash
cargo test
```

2. Run the system tests twice: once with the verification pack and once with a fresh pack.
```bash
./test-scripts/check.sh ./target/release/elfshaker ./test-scripts/artifacts/verification.pack
./test-scripts/check.sh ./target/release/elfshaker $(contrib/create-test-pack ./target/release/elfshaker 5 64)
```

**Some tests may fail to run if you are running on a non-standard Linux environment (like if you don't have `/dev/shm`).**

3. Run clippy to ensure your code is formatted appropriately.
```bash
cargo clippy
```

## After opening a pull request
Go to the `Checks` tab on your new pull request and make sure all tests are passing and there are no warnings.

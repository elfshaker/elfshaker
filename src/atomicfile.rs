/// AtomicCreateFile provides an API for atomically creating a file, determining
/// if it exists before proceeding to do potentially expensive work to fill it.
/// The primitives should be used like this:
///
///     use std::path::Path;
///     let atomic_create_handle = elfshaker::atomicfile::AtomicCreateFile::new(Path::new("destination_path")).unwrap();
///     // ... on error, report that the file might already exist
///     //     (though it may not yet be ready) ...
///     // ... otherwise, do potentially long running work ...
///     use std::io::Cursor;
///     let mut reader = std::io::Cursor::new(b"foo");
///     atomic_create_handle.commit_content(&mut reader).unwrap();
///     // ... files are closed here ...
///
/// 1. If the file already exists and has non-zero size, it is an error in
///    ::new.
/// 2. If the file exists and has an exclusive lock on it, another process is
///    approaching commit_content(), and it is an 'already exists' error.
/// 3. If the file exists, has size zero, and has no exclusive lock; the
///    original process is assumed to have crashed. The stale file is deleted,
///    and a new one is attempted to be made.
/// 4. commit_content writes its content into a randomly named file in the same
///    directory as the destination_path, and then uses rename() to the
///    destination to achieve an atomic update.
/// 5. As a convenience, if file creation fails because parent directories don't
///    exist, create them and proceed. This handily avoids the work of checking
///    if parent directories exist and creating them, saving on syscalls in the
///    success case.
///
/// The motivation is to prevent multiple processes from wasting effort creating
/// the same file, so that one process 'wins' and the others can return an
/// error. Additionally, locks are used so that it is possible to determine if a
/// process was uncleanly interrupted (even under SIGKILL), and treat the file
/// as though it doesn't yet exist. Further, stale temporary files can be
/// identified as files with the prefix .elfshakertmp_ which have no exclusive
/// lock held.
///
/// Additionally, AtomicCreateFile::prune_stale_file(p) returns true if the
/// given path `p` is an empty file with no lock held. In that case, the file is
/// deleted with the lock held so the name can be reused.
